# Martian Robots

## How the project has been developed

After read de documentation provided the firts thing done has been define what kind of application is wanted to get. 
At this point, it has been chosen to develop a ASP.NET CORE 3.1 Web API. 
Due to the time of developing it might will have a simple UI.

Considerations taking before start the developing process:

1. Visual Studio Code has been selected as principal IDE. 
2. Entity Framework is the ORM selected to boost the database integration and persistance data. 
3. Non Relational DB has been refused because of data types. As we want to keep in mind that this app could be increase, main data models (robot, sensors, grid position, info from the grid, astronauts in mars...) could have a relationship between each others.
